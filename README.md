### Project Title

### Goal
This project aims to present descriptive statistics and to answer interesting questions about a bike share system.

### Description
In this project, I make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States : Chicago, New York City, and Washington.
I wrote a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal.

Topics covered are the most frequent times of travel, the most popular stations and trip, the total and average trip duration and statistics on bikeshare users.
